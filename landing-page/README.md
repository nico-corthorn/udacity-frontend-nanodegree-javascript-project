## Instructions

To see the page open file index.html in your browser (double click on the file).

## Code

This is a very simple page. It contains:
- One HTML file: `index.html`. Contains the page content (text). The only change made compared to the one provided by Udacity was to add more sections as specified.
- One CSS file, `css/styles.css`. Contains the page styling. Only additions were styling for the navigation bar and better highlighting the active section.
- One JavaScript fie, `js/app.js`. Contains page functionality. Coded from scratch. It builds the navigation bar based on the HTML content, scrolls to the appropriate section when clicked in the nav bar, and activates a section depending on the scroll position.
