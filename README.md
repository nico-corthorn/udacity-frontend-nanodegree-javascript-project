## Project Description

Second project of the Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree program. In this project an HTML and CSS was provided and a JavaScript file had to be coded from scratch.

The JavaScript file adds some common interactions used in a webpage. This includes:
- Building the navigation bar automatically based on the HTML content.
- Activating sections based on the scroll position.
- Scrolling to a section when clicked in the navigation bar.

The main concepts tested in this project are:
- Quering elements in the DOM.
- Manipulating those elements (e.g. adding elements or changing CSS class list of an element)
- Using event listeners for triggering JavaScript code upon user actions.

## Instructions

Download the repo and then double click on index.html to see the page in your browser.

## Code

This is a very simple page. It contains:
- One HTML file: `index.html`. Contains the page content (text). The only change made compared to the one provided by Udacity was to add more sections as specified.
- One CSS file, `css/styles.css`. Contains the page styling. Only additions were styling for the navigation bar and better highlighting the active section.
- One JavaScript fie, `js/app.js`. Contains page functionality. Coded from scratch. It builds the navigation bar based on the HTML content, scrolls to the appropriate section when clicked in the nav bar, and activates a section depending on the scroll position.
